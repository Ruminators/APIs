I just felt so helpless
I was having trouble with friends at school and I became detached from my family. I was/am thinking negative thoughts about myself and I am often down, tired and just simply not happy. I tried to take my life, when my school found out they had to call my mum. I had to go to the doctor and now I have to see a counsellor.
I think it is good that I have been diagnosed with depression because it means that I can get help.
I admit that it is a lengthy process in front of me but I am looking forward to being my old bubbly self. Many adults don't understand depression; they don't understand how teenagers are affected by simple things like friend changes and the stress at school.
My aim is to start next year brand new, and stay happy.
