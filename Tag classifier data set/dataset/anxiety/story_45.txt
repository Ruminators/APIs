Personal stories
Ann 79
My life's a see-saw ... Up and down
My life's a see-saw
Up and down.
My life's a chameleon
Constantly changing.
My life's a kaleidoscope
Forever fragmenting.
My life's a volcano
Where eruptions abound.
Poetry and walking,
Music and nature,
And quite times,
These are my tether.
Love and compassion
Hold me together.
