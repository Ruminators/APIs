PostsHi
I wondered if anyone else has also found out they have a deficiency in any areas whilst suffering from anxiety? A while back i was deficient in B12 and now generally anaemic due to lack of iron. Both of these deficiencies can impact on mental health. My GP tends to treat them quite separate from my MH difficulties- i wondered what everyones else’s experiences were?I had a “severe” (according to doctors letter to me and my GP) vitamin D deficiency a couple of years back that I was told was common in the elderly. I’m not sure if it was related to my anxiety or not, perhaps not wanting to go out socially, and being busy with work at the time..Yes I was also told I was iron and B12 deficient, but I think this is a fairly common thing so not sure it is linked to anxiety?I was also diagnosed with a severe Vitamin D deficiency. I did a lot of online research into this and it seems to be linked again and again with anxiety and depression. Definitely a link there and worth exploring with your dr. However, months later my D levels are stable and while my anxiety is the same, I have less aches and pains and feel more healthy than I did before (in a general sense!)Posts
