PostsHi, I withdrew from Citalopram 6 months ago and it‚Äôs left me so much worse off and has messed up my hormones pretty badly. I saw a forum of people who‚Äôve developed horrible chronic conditions from withdrawing off antidepressants and it scared me so much. My worst fear is PGAD (persistent genital arousal disorder) which I had last time I withdrew from them in 2016. It started 6 or 7 months after I hit 0mg (apparently 6-7 months is the usual time to develop these chronic conditions but it can happen from any time within maybe 2 years after) so now that I‚Äôm at the 6-month mark again I‚Äôm terrified it‚Äôs going to come back and this time be permanent and/or constant like other people have it. Others get nerve damage, autoimmune diseases, severe hormone problems, mental problems, psychosis, etc. PGAD is sort of both a nerve damage/irritation and hormone problem (can be either or both). I can‚Äôt believe ADs are still being prescribed when they just leave people 1000x worse off than before they took them. Sorry, I‚Äôm sort of ranting now. I‚Äôm just so scared and I don‚Äôt know how to deal with the anxiety of KNOWING that I could actually very likely get this horrible painful condition that has no cure or effective treatment. How do you deal with knowing that? Has anyone else been in a situation like this? And has anyone else withdrew from long-term antidepressant use?
Thanks to anyone who replies. üôÅ
