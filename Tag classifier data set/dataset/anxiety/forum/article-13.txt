PostsI am sat here at work right now, with my a knot in my middle. I keep expecting to have an argument with someone about the smallest thing that never turns up. I look in the mirror at home in the mornings dreading going to work wondering who is going to say something to me I am not going to like. I try and breath through it, like I have been told in the head space teachings, I talk to my wife about my issues and she try’s her best to show me a path out but 9 out of 10 I don’t take it and start ripping myself up inside. How can anyone live with this, how can I live with this, I have just started a new job after being made redundant again for the seventh time and its hurts wondering how long this job is going to last ( I think that is part of the problem) My family is the most important thing to me I just don’t want to fail them. What do I do?And I will just add, writing this down just helped me a lot, but I know I have a long way to go.Posts
