PostsHi everyone. I am new to this site so I thought an interesting way to get to know some of you would be to find out about your interests.
A huge passion of mine is animals, as someone who has grown up their entire life with pets, Iâ€™m interested to know if any other members have pets and if you find them a benefit to helping you with your struggles?
I have 3 pets myself and find them to be a massive advantage when it comes to my troubles.
Let me know about your furry friends below:)TestHi There, QWelcome. I agree! I have 2 rabbits and 4 chickens, and lovely fresh eggs each morning ðŸ™‚ I will be getting a dog soon. Letâ€™s hope it doesnâ€™t chase the chickens!Posts
