PostsHi. I’m a 56 year old lady, suffering from anxiety, living in Eastbourne. I am looking for new friends in the area or penpals, who may also suffer from anxiety, for mutual support.. Anyone interested, please reply.Hi Claire I’m not from Sussex but wouldn’t mind being penpals; It would be nice to speak to someone with anxiety as I don’t know anyone else with it.Hi Claire I’m not from Sussex but wouldn’t mind being penpals; It would be nice to speak to someone with anxiety as I don’t know anyone else with it.Posts
