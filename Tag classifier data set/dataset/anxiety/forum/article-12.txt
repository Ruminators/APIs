PostsHello,
Has anybody ever felt General Anxiety Disorder? What kind of methods/ solutions have been used to get better over time? I am currently attending a Stress Awareness Course to better understand the coping mecanism and will consider Counselling/CBT. Are there any other tips anyone could suggest? Have you had to re-organise your daily routine? Any response would help to see how other individuals are trying to cope? Many thanks.Posts
