PostsCurrently a big anxiety for me is not being able to sleep. I am currently awaiting diagnosis of my conditions and am also very depressed and have low-level functioning. I am on short term medication of Diazepam and Zopiclone. I have taken Zopiclone the last 2 nights but still only sleep 3-4 hrs and then wake up. My anxiety is that even if I get better my sleep will still suffer greatly. I am scared of not sleeping.
What tips/suggestions might someone have for help in my situation?
Thank youPosts
