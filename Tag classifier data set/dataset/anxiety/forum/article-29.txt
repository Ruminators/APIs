PostsAre there any others with this fear? (phobia relating to either self or others being physically sick).
Struggling hugely with intrusive thoughts at the moment and I don’t really know what to do with myself.I don’t have emetophobia myself but when I get intrusive thoughts, I will try and distract myself as much as possible. Podcasts are good to focus on and take your mind off these thoughts – someone recommended me “The Anxiety Coaches” a while ago but I haven’t listened to it yet! Also, make use of that Headspace subscription that came with your membership! 🙂 These things won’t cure the problem, but they might help in the short term. xxI really should make more use of the Headspace app, my issue is focus. I can’t shut up my inner voice, no matter how patient I am or how hard I try – it’s incredibly frustrating.I agree that Headspace may really help in the long run with this- it is about developing a routine so you can benefit from it. I currently do 10 minutes a day- and this is both doable and sustainable.
There is a book that you also might find helpful in allowing you to slowly change the relationship you have with that ‘inner voice’. It is called ‘The happiness trap’ by Russ Harris -it is easy to read and really helps to see your thoughts and gradually react to them in a different way. It sounds like you have the fear and unhelpful thoughts and then have the secondary emotion of frustration and annoyance. Even if you cannot immediately change your thoughts you can work on how you relate to these- which i think the book could help you with. Good luckPosts
