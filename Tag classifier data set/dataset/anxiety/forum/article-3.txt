PostsWelcome to the Off-Topic section of the message board! Here we can get a little more informal and discuss subjects that wonâ€™t pertain directly to anxiety. We are all individuals outside of our condition, of course! Are you an avid crafter? Horror movie buff? What was the last book you read that really moved you?

They are ok if the anxiety isnâ€™t too high. I use mindfulness a lot too. Good luck finding what works for you.Hi Becca and Eve. No I havenâ€™t tried lavender kalms yet. I am taking 5-htp, vit b complex, vit d3, calcium with magnesium and zinc, and omega 3 tablets. I am also menopausal and cannot tolerate dairy products well, hence the calcium. I have started using headspace for meditation, also have a natural rainfall app which really helps. I also listen to podcasts from â€˜the anxiety guyâ€™. All ok so far, things certainly havenâ€™t got any worse! I have also started journalling which helps.Hi Alison, there is meant to be links to vitamin deficiency and anxiety/depression.
