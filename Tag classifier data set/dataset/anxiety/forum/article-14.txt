PostsHi group. I struggle with irationality of situations which I fear will have devastating consequences which arenâ€™t bad but I fear they will be. Any help appreciated?Hi,
I sometimes have irrational thought too so I know how scary it can feel at the time. Personally I find talking the situation through with a trusted friend helps me to put things in perspective. Do you have anyone you can talk to?Posts
