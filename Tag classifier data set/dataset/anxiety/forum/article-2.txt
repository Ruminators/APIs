PostsI am a student and there is a lot of pressure for me to find a job as University is expensive however, I am finding it difficult to find a job that I am comfortable with as I suffer with social anxiety and struggle with many social situations. I was wondering if anyone else had experienced this or if they have found any jobs that suites there social anxiety?Hi, I would suggest that it is really important to find an understanding employer. Then you can talk about ways of managing tasks that particularly challenge you. For years I have avoided talking about it but in my current role I have been up front about it and the support I have had is incredible.I would also appreciate some advice or tips on how to handle social anxiety and employment. I was recently offered a job and itâ€™s been a dream of mine to work for the company I got the offer from. However due to social anxiety and g.a.d I turned the job offer down as i felt as though i was not able to cope with it.Posts
